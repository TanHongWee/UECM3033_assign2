## Task 1 --  $LU$ Factorization or SOR method

The reports, codes and supporting documents are to be uploaded to Github at: 

[https://github.com/your_github_id/UECM3033_assign1](https://github.com/your_github_id/UECM3033_assign1)

Explain your selection criteria here.

-The condition is set to be np.count_nonzero(A) > 1/2*len(A). Sparse matrix is a matrix where most of the elements are zeros, so in this case, if the nonzeros is greater that half of the length of matrix A then we will choose LU method. Iterative methods, which consist of SOR method are well-suited for sparse matrix.

Explain how you implement your `task1.py` here.

 -In task 1 , self define function of lu, sor and solve are created. For LU method, two matrix will be created with is the lower matrix and upper matrix whereby A=LU, thus Ax=LUx=b, so will be define into Ly=b and Ux= y. So, we can get the x matrix after getting the y matrix.As for the SOR method, omega is assume to be 1.03 which is within the range of 1<omega<2 that will converge for any initial vector if A matrix is symmetric and positive definite. If omega is greater than 2 , SOR method will diverge. If 0 < omega<1, SOR method converges but the convergence rate is slower than the Gauss-Seidal method. Then, the iteration limit also needed to be set so that it will not loop until infinity time. In this task, the iteration limit is assumed to be 10. We start the iteration by assuming the first x is a zero vector. Then we will substitute each x we found to count the new x and iterate until the iteration limit.In order to find the exact answer, let sol equal to np.linalg.solve(A,b) else the answer will not be true.

## Task 2 -- SVD method and image compression

Put here your picture file (Image.jpg)

![Image.jpg](Image.jpg)

How many non zero element in $\Sigma$?

-The number of non zero elements in original Sigma of red, green, blue matrices are 800 , 800 and 800 respectively.

Put here your lower and better resolution pictures. Explain how you generate
these pictures from `task2.py`.
![lower.png](lower.png)
When the resolution is lower , $\Sigma_{30}$

![better.png](better.png)

When the resolution is better, $\Sigma_{200}$

-This figures show when the $\Sigma$ is keeping the first 30 and 200 non zero elements. In order to generate the pictures, firstly, push the new "Image" by using github.Then, the image is needed to be read in order to get the 3 matrices which is the r,g and b. Each of the r,g and b is a 3 dimension matrix. In order to find the U,$\Sigma$ and V of the three matrices which named as Ur,Sr and Vr for the red matrix, Ug,Sg,Vg for the green matrix and Ub,Sb,Vb for the blue matrix, scipy.linalg.svd is used. Then, the image is plotted by using "plt.figure". After that, to find the non zero elements in $\Sigma$, numpy.count_nonzero can be used. Next, image is needed to be compressed by keeping the first 30 non zero elements as in $\Sigma$ and set all other non zero elements to zero. This will construct a lower resolution matrix.A self define function is created for this purpose. Firstly, a copy of the original $\Sigma$ to avoid loss of information by using Sr.copy and same goes to blue and green. Then only start to keep the first n non zero elements and set others to zero by using Sr1[n:800]=np.zeros_like(Sr[n:800]). Then, the Sr1 is needed to be change to dimension (800x1000) which is originally (800,1) by using sp.linalg.diagsvd so that no dimensional error will occur when combine it to a matrix of U,$\Sigma$,V by dot multiplication. So, a new matrix is created by the dot multiplication of np.dot. Then, all the process is repeated by green and blue matrices. After all this, another figure is plotted which shows a lower resolution. In part 4, a new better resolution can be plotted by calling the self define function again.

What is a sparse matrix?

-A sparse matrix is a matrix which most of the elements are zero. On the other hand, a matrix is called dense where most of the elements are non zero. In this task, sparse matrix is formed when the first 30 elements of $\Sigma$ is kept and other elements are set to zero. When the dimension of $\Sigma$ is converted to (800,1000), which is consider as a large sparse matrix, then this will create a lower resolution of pictures when it is combined with U and V by using dot multiplication.
